#### What have you done for your project so far?

I have made a data list and dictionaries. I also made an hotkey and working on combining the hotkey with the data.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

Combining the data with the hotkey and an auto clicker for pressing the start button.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

Trying to figure out how to combing the hotkey and data together, making a message box without messing up the code, and also a little bit more with the calculation part of my project.
