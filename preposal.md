# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

I Want to make a program that can help me in the future for when I work. I use an app that helps me print logos and put heat press them on shirts for my job and wanted to make a program that automatically counts the amount of logos you need and have. It also will start and add the count every time you hit the start button on the app.
## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

I am working on my own.

## Do you have any questions of your own?

I don't have any questions I can think of.
