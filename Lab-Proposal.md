# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Logos counter

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A program that helps count logos on software I use for my job. You can manually put the amount of logos on the sheet and it will keep counting everything you hit the start button.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

I work for a company that makes logos and heat-press them on shirts. I wanted to make a program that will help me be more lazy in work and count and show the amount of logos I need to do till I am finished. I wanted to make something that automatically sees your logos and can tell what is different or the same. Or you manually put in the amount of logos in one sheet and then that when the program will tell you how much you need. I also wanted the program to tell me every time I hit the start button.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

I am working solo.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A good outcome will be when the program can at least count how many logos you need and show you.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better outcome will be when the program can tell that I am hitting a button on another app I am using on my computer and automatically tell me the amount of logos I have with me going to python and manually telling it that I am on my next sheet. (You can put logos on a sheet and then just multiply the amount of logos per sheet. Ex: you did 4 sheets and each sheet have 3 logos on it. 4*3 = 12 so you have 12 logos now.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best out is when it can see the amount of logos, automatically count when you hit the start button on the app, and count the logos and show you.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

What new skill I can learn is how to use a program and make it work on another application. This project will help me be able to use the everyday application I use for my job and help me count without me writing down notes. I will try to look up websites that can help me be able to use my program and let it see another thing on my computer. I can also learn more things about python and what kind of imports I will need to put in. I won't be working with any partners and do everything on my own.
